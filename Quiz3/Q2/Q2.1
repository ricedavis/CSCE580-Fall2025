- The state is represented using 5 elements: (left_missionaries, left_cannibals, right_missionaries, right_cannibals, boat_position).
- start state: (3,3,0,0,"left"), goal state: (0,0,3,3,"right").
- so the goal is: All missionaries and cannibals are on the right bank, and the boat is also on the right.
- The search strategy implemented is Breadth-First Search.
