After running my DFS algorithm on all 6 test cases from the tester program, here are the results:

1M, 1C -> [(1, 1)] | Time: 0.0000s
2M, 2C -> [(1, 1), (1, 0), (2, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2)] | Time: 0.0001s
3M, 3C -> [(1, 1), (1, 0), (0, 2), (0, 1), (2, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 1), (0, 2)] | Time: 0.0001s
4M, 3C -> [(1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1)] | Time: 0.0001s
5M, 3C -> [(1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1), (1, 1)] | Time: 0.0001s
2M, 3C -> [] | Time: 0.0001s

The program was able to efficiently solve every test case except for 2M, 3C. This was an impossible case with no valid moves.
The time to solve was very small for each test case, meaning the DFS algorithm was very efficient.
