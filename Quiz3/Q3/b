Psuedocode for Arc consistency:

1. Start with all variables and their possible values (domains).

2. Make a list of all constraints between pairs of variables
   (for example: 2O = R + 10c1, 2W + c1 = U + 10c2, etc.).

3. Repeat until no more changes occur:
      For each pair of related variables (X, Y):
          Look at every value of X.
          If there is no value of Y that satisfies the constraint between X and Y,
             remove that value from X’s domain.
          If any value was removed,
             re-check all constraints connected to X again.

4. Stop when no domains can be reduced further
   (the CSP is now "arc consistent").
