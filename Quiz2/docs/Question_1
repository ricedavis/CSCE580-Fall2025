a) I chose to compare search actions, writing assistant and translation between LLM's and classical methods:
      For Search: AI Search - 2.9 Wh per query
                  Traditional search - 0.3 Wh per query
      For Writing: AI Writing assistant - 1.5 Wh per session
                   Basic text editor - 0.1 Wh per session
      For Translation: AI translator - 2.9 Wh per query
                       Basic translator - 0.3 Wh per query

b) The average energy difference is 2.2 Wh. On average, LLM is higher by 2.2 Wh.
