Baked Apples With Cottage Cheese & Cinnamon

Supplies
Apples — 4

Cottage cheese — 150 g (about ¾ cup)

Sugar — 2 tbsp

Cinnamon — 0.5 tsp

Step 1:

Wash the apples and cut off the “lid” (the top part of the apple, where the stem is.) — as you can see in the photo.

Step 2:


Use a small spoon to scoop out the core of the apples. Be careful not to make a hole. Keep the apple walls thick (about 1 cm, or even thicker).

Step 3:

Mix the cottage cheese, cinnamon, and sugar. Stir until smooth and well combined.

Step 4:



Fill the apples with the mixture, as shown in the photo. Cover each apple with its “lid.”

Step 5:

Line a baking tray with parchment paper (this makes cleanup easier and prevents the apples from burning), and place all the apples on it.

Step 6:



Bake the apples in a preheated oven at 200°C (about 390°F) until they become soft, usually 30–40 minutes. Use the bake setting — this means heat comes from both the top and bottom of the oven.

Step 7:


You can serve the apples immediately while they’re still hot (photo 2), or wait until they cool, sprinkle with powdered sugar, and top with a little whipped cream (photo 1). It’s up to you!

Just don’t add whipped cream or powdered sugar to hot apples — the cream will melt and the sugar will simply dissolve.
