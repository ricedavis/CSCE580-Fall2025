In addition, we will consider what we might do to equitably mitigate risks that are associated with our decision making.\n",

By default, this threshold is 0.5, but it can be changed to any value between 0 and 1. Different thresholds will result in different TP and FP rates, all of which are illustrated on our graph. we can calculate the area underneath this curve in order to get a sense as to how our classifiers might work across a wide range of different thresholds.

    "The distributions look comparable, but there may be a small collection of outliers with respect to 'BMI' and/or high systolic blood pressure who were misclassified. Some of these individual examples might warrant a closer look. Perhaps there is something about these individuals that compromised estimates due to BMI?  Note that many of these features will of course co-vary, and the way they co-vary can be revealing as well.  Later on in this course, we will look at tools and techniques to look for emergent patterns in ways that are sensitive to covariance. We could in theory use any patterns we discover in our errors to both inform and improve our model.\n",

To do this, we will stratify, or group, the errors in our predictions as they relate to groups of interest.  Note, of course, that our ability to group people in any way depends on how they have been identified in our data! Our understanding of how to categorize \"identity\" changes with place and time. This is a limitation that we will need to keep in mind, and about which we will need to be transparent when we report on our analyses.\n",

In addition, the team wants to guarantee a consistent sensitivity across both women and men.
